# Eventity App

Responding to the growing need for a user-friendly and efficient event booking solution, we proudly represent Eventity, a revolutionary
application developed with the goal of offering users the ability to search for events near their location that match their interests, as well as 
easily purchase a ticket. Additionally, the app offers a smart Chatbot built with the Microsoft Bot Framework tool. With the multilingual NLP chatbot, 
every user can get help, make reservations and access booking information in their preferred language, not only through the app where it is directly accessible
but also on various social media platforms such as MS Teams, Facebook and other. Eventity also provides to the events' organizers a user-friendly online environment
for efficient event management. In addition, the inclusion of QRCodes as e-tickets ensures fast and hassle-free entry to events. Eventity is here to transform the way 
guests experience events by offering a complete solution for both them and event organizers. This repository represents the Eventity Android Application for simple Users.
